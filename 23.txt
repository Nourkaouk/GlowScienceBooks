Respiratory system processes:  Breathing occurs when we take oxygen into the body (lungs) and push carbon dioxide out of the body. Breathing therefore occurs in two phases: Inhalation, Exhalation.
 Gaseous exchange takes place at two locations by a process called diffusion: in the alveoli, oxygen diffuses into the blood from the lungs and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood back into the lungs. At the body tissues oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells and carbon dioxide from the cells diffuses into the blood.
Cellular respiration occurs within the mitochondria of cells to release the chemical energy in food.
