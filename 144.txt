During the collision, itâ€™s possible that some of the initial kinetic energy of the bodies may be converted into heat and sound energy, and energy that does work in deforming the colliding bodies. 
We classify collisions into three categories: perfectly elastic collision is one in which none of the initial kinetic energy is converted into heat or deformation. perfectly inelastic collision is one in which all of the initial kinetic energy is converted into heat and deformation. Most collisions lie between these two extremes, and some of the initial kinetic energy is converted into heat. Such collisions are called inelastic.
