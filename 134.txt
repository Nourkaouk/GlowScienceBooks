Vector arithmetic can be done by drawing the vectors as arrows on graph paper, and measuring the results with a ruler and protractor. The advantage of the graphical methods are that they give a good intuitive picture of what’s going on to help you visualize what you’re trying to do. The disadvantages are that the graphical methods can be time-consuming, and not very accurate. The graphical methods are usually used to make a quick sketch, to help organize your thinking, so you can be clear that you’re doing things correctly. The algebraic methods are then used for the actual calculations.
