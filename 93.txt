Salts are compounds that are formed by the reaction of acids with bases. A great number of salts play an important role in our daily life. For example, common salt (sodium chloride) is essential for life and helps to preserve food. Mixtures are substances that consist of two or more pure substances, in which the substances retain their identity. Mixtures are not pure substances because they have a variable composition and no unique set of properties. They can be separated by physical means. For example, when the sodium chloride (common salt) is mixed with water, it forms a salt solution.
