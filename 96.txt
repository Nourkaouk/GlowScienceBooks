In a homogeneous mixture, the proportions of components may vary from sample to sample. A mixture that does not have a uniform composition throughout is known as a heterogeneous mixture. The components of a heterogeneous mixture can be identified by eyes or with the help of a microscope. They contain more than one phase. For example, a mixture of sand and iron filings is a heterogeneous mixture. This is because the sand particles remain visible and physically separated. Blood is also a heterogeneous mixture of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, etc that can be seen using a microscope.
