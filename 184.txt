Alcohol acts on neurotransmitter systems in the brain to dampen down excitatory messages and promote inhibition of neural activity. Alcoholâ€™s action proceeds through stages of relaxation, after one drink, through to sleepiness and loss of consciousness. That is why the police are so strict about drinking and driving, and why there is so much public support for this strict attitude. Some people become very aggressive and even violent when they drink, and about one in ten of regular drinkers will become dependent alcoholics. Long-term alcohol use damages the body, especially the liver, and can cause permanent damage to the brain.
