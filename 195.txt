The spinal cord plays an important part in the control of the muscles through different reflex pathways. Among these are the withdrawal reflexes that protect you from sharp or hot objects, and the stretch reflexes that have a role in posture. The well-known ‘knee-jerk’ reflex is an example of a stretch reflex that is rather special because it involves only two types of nerve cell - sensory neurons that signal muscle length, connected through synapses to motor neurons that cause the movement. These reflexes combine together with more complex ones, in spinal circuits that organise more or less complete behaviours.
