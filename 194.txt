Decisions about motion and colour: A subject of great current interest is how neurons are involved in making decisions about visual motion. Whether or not an object is moving, and in which direction, are critically important judgements for humans and other animals. Relative movement generally indicates that an object is different from other nearby objects. The regions of the visual brain involved in processing motion information can be identified as distinct anatomical regions by examining the patterns of connections between brain areas, by using human brain imaging techniques, and by recording the activity of individual neurons in non human animals.
