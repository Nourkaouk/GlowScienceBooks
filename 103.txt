The ancient Greek philosophers described matter as continuous or discrete. Some of them argued that matter is continuous i.e., it could be divided endlessly into smaller pieces. Others believed that matter is discrete; i.e., it cannot be infinitely divided. Democritus thought that substances are made up of tiny indivisible particles. If a piece of copper is cut into smaller and smaller pieces one finally reaches a point where it can no longer be divided. He called these particles atoms. The word atom has its origin from the Greek word “Atomos” which means indivisible. Thus according to Democritus matter is discrete.
