An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary chemical means. An element is composed of only one kind of matter (atoms). At present, more than 115 elements are known. Among these elements, 92 of them occur naturally while the rest are man-made or artificial elements. Elements are classified as metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals are elements characterized by their shiny appearance (luster), electrical conductivity, malleability and ductility. The malleability is the ability of a substance to be pressed into sheets when hammered. Ductility is the ability to be drawn into thin wire.
