Except for a black hole (which has infinite density), the densest object in Nature is a neutron star. Normally a star is in a state of equilibrium, with outward radiation pressure balancing the inward gravitational pressure. But when the star runs out of fuel, the outward radiation pressure is gone, and the star collapses under its gravity. If the star is large enough, gravity can be strong enough to push the electrons of the atoms into the nucleus, forming “neutron star”, which is essentially a giant ball of neutrons. A typical neutron star has a density of 10 14 g/cm3.
