There are a number of treatments for dyslexia, each indicated by different hypotheses about its underlying cause. Sum focus on the magnocellular hypothesis, other accounts distinguish different forms of the acquired condition, known as surface and deep dyslexia, which may require different kinds of treatment. All treatments rely on early diagnosis. Scientists do not always agree on things and the best treatment for dyslexia is one such area of disagreement. It has been suggested recently that problems in sound processing result in some dyslexics going down the wrong path for learning about sounds using the brainâ€™s normal mechanisms of plasticity.
