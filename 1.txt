All living organisms, including plants, animals, bacteria and fungi, are made up of cells. Cells are the smallest parts of all living organisms. If we look at all the living organisms in the world we see that there are two main types of organisms based on the structures of their cells. The most important difference in structure is the presence of a nucleus. Cells that contain a nucleus are classified as eukaryotic cells, while those without a nucleus are prokaryotic cells. In this chapter we will specifically look at eukaryotic cells that make up organisms such as plants and animals.
