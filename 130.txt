SI units were originally based mostly on the properties of the Earth and of water. Under the original definitions: The meter was defined to be one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to North Pole, along a line of longitude passing through Paris. The kilogram was defined as the mass of 0.001 m3 of water. The second was defined as 1/86,400 the length of day (one rotation of the Earth). The definition of the ampere is related to electrical properties, ultimately relating to the meter, kilogram, and second. The kelvin was defined in terms of the thermodynamic properties of water.
