Bases are substances that release hydroxide ion in water solution. The characteristic properties of bases are due to the presence of hydroxide ions. They turn red litmus paper to blue. Bases neutralize acids. For example, magnesium hydroxide, known as ‘milk of magnesia’ is a common anti acid that helps to neutralize excess hydrochloric acid in our stomach. Some bases are soluble and others are insoluble in water. Oxides: Oxygen combines with most of the elements, to form compounds known as oxides. Oxides are compounds that consist of oxygen and one other element. Hence, oxides are binary compounds that contain oxygen.
