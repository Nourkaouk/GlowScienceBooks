Nicotine is the active ingredient in all tobacco products. Nicotine acts on brain receptors that normally recognise the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Given this, itâ€™s not surprising that smokers say that cigarettes help them concentrate and have a soothing effect. The trouble is that nicotine is highly addictive and many inveterate smokers continue to smoke for no better reason than to avoid the unpleasant signs of withdrawal if they stop. The pleasure has long gone. While there appears to be no deleterious effect on the brain, tobacco smoke is extremely damaging to the lungs and long-term exposure can lead to lung cancer.
