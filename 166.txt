Besides mid-ocean ridges and hotspots, another geological setting where abundant magma is produced is the subduction zone. In subduction zones, oceanic plate is sliding beneath another plate and plunges into the asthenospheric mantle. The subducting oceanic plate is relatively cold in comparison with surrounding rocks. What is causing rock melting in this case? The water and the process of magma formation is called water-induced melting. The subducting oceanic plate carries a lot of sediments and sedimentary rocks with relatively high water content. Water is present in the open space between sediment grains and in the crystal lattice of clay minerals.
