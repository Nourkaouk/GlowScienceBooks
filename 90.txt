Elements can combine with other elements to form compounds. Sodium chloride is formed by the combination of sodium and chlorine elements. Such types of compounds that are formed by the combination of two different elements are called binary compounds. Most binary compounds contain metallic and non metallic elements. A compound is not a mixture of elements. This is because each element in a compound does not retain its identity. The properties of a compound are completely different from the properties of the elements that make up the compound. For example, sodium chloride is a compound composed of sodium and chlorine.
