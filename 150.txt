The way we measure time for civil use (years, months, days, weeks, etc.) is not particularly convenient for astronomical calculations. A more convenient way to measure time is with the Julian day. The Julian Day is simply a count of the total number of days that have elapsed since noon on Monday, January 1, 4713 B.C. (Notice that the Julian Day begins at noon, not at midnight as on our civil calendar.) The calendar date may be converted to and from Julian Day using some fairly simple, well-known algorithms (see e.g. Meeus, 1991), or by the use of pre-computed tables.
