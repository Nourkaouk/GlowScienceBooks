Newton’s first law states that bodies have a property called inertia, which means that once given a velocity, they will travel at that same velocity forever, unless acted upon by some outside force. Nobody knows why this is; it’s just the way the Universe works. In retrospect, this was a brilliant deduction by Newton. In real life, if you push an object across the floor, it will slide for a while, then come to a stop. This behavior caused Aristotle to believe a moving body was filled with some sort of substance that was “used up” as the body moved.
