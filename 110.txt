A neutron is a tiny neutral particle located in the nucleus of an atom. All neutrons are exactly alike. In many atoms, the number of neutrons is higher than that of protons. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. Atomic number (Z) = Number of protons Mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom. It is symbolized by “A”. Sodium, for example, contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons. Thus the atomic number of sodium is 11 and its mass number is 23. Mass number (A) = Number of protons + Number of neutrons.
