Amphetamines are man-made chemicals that include “Dexedrine”, “Speed”, and the methamphetamine derivative called “Ecstasy”. These drugs act in the brain by causing the release two naturally occurring neurotransmitters. One is dopamine - which probably explains the strong pleasurable effects of amphetamines. The other is serotonin - which is thought to account for their ability to cause a sense of well-being and a dream-like state that can include hallucinations. Dexedrine and Speed promote mainly dopamine release, Ecstasy more serotonin. The even more powerful hallucinogen d-LSD also acts on serotonin mechanisms in the brain. Amphetamines can be dangerous - especially in overdose.
