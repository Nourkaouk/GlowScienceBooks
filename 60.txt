A structure is something that is arranged or put together in a specific way and is made up of different parts. A jungle gym is a type of structure. Most structures are designed to remain stable and rigid which means they should not break and crumble or topple and fall over if something heavy is placed on top of or against them. Structures have different jobs or functions. They support, protect, enclose - that means they keep something in or they keep things from getting in (like a tin of juice or a fence around a building), help with movement.
