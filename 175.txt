Only about 1 percent of DNA is made up of protein-coding genes; the other 99 percent is noncoding. Scientists once thought noncoding DNA was “junk,” with no known purpose. However, it is becoming clear that at least some of it is integral to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity. For example, noncoding DNA contains sequences that act as regulatory elements, determining when and where genes are turned on and off. Such elements provide sites for specialized proteins to attach and either activate or repress the process by which the information from genes is turned into proteins.
