Nebular Hypothesis: Several observations should be explained by any attempt to understand how our solar system formed: The planets are all moving in the same direction around the Sun. The Sun is also rotating counterclockwise. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular and lie in the same narrow plane which coincides with the Sun’s equatorial plane (except Mercury whose orbit inclines 7º concerning Earth’s orbital plane). Satellites in orbit around planets are revolving in the same counterclockwise direction. The Inner planets are smaller, denser and mostly rocky; the outer planets are larger and mostly made of gas or ice.
