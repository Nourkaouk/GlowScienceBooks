The contracting nebula evolves into a fast-rotating, flattened disk, the center of which is occupied by a dense and bright star in formation. The temperature inside the proto-star is so high that elements exist in the form of atoms stripped of their electrons (plasma). When the temperature at the center of the disk reaches 12,000,000 ºC, the hydrogen nuclei overcome electrostatic repulsion and begin to fuse. This is the beginning of nuclear fusion, a chain reaction producing a great amount of energy and responsible for our Sun’s heat. The start of nuclear fusion marks the birth of a new star.
