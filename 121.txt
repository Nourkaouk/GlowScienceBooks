The cut off value is a special performance parameter, since it has been widely studied and used in the qualitative analytical methods that use instrumental responses. Regarding the qualitative methods with sensorial responses, this value means the concentration level where the qualitative method differentiates the samples with a certain probability of error, usually of 5%. In the particular case of problems related to the maximum permitted level, the cut-off value is related to the sensitivity, as it corresponds to the concentration level at which the sensitivity rate is 95%, when the Î² -type error probability has been set at 5%.
