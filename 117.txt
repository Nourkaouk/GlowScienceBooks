In routine laboratories, for example, it is quite usual for the first stage to determine whether one or more analytes are present/absent in a sample and, if so, for the second step to estimate their concentration level. For example, to assess if a sample of drinking water is free from pollutants. Therefore, instead of trying to quantify the pollutants in the sample as the first goal, it could be enough just to ensure if they are present above or below the permitted concentration level. Qualitative methods are used in these cases. They are commonly used as screening techniques before quantification.
