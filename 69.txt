We use metals every day, sometimes even without knowing! Metals are ductile and good conductors of electricity. This is why metal is used to make the wire inside electrical cables. Without electrical cables we would not have electricity in our homes or schools; we would not have lights or television, or telephones. (Next term we will look more at electricity!) Metals are extremely strong and can be turned into thin sheets. These sheets can be used to make the bodies of the cars, trucks, trains and aeroplanes that are used to transport people and goods from one place to another.
