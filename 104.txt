Daltonâ€™s Atomic Theory: Scientific explanations that focus on the existence of atoms are the basis of the atomic theory. A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observed scientific law. When a hypothesis is proved by repeated experiments and accepted by a scientific community, it comes to be a theory. A number of scientists contributed to the development of the atomic theory. However modern atomic concepts began with the work of John Dalton an English scientist. There were two key experimental findings about chemical reactions before the time of Dalton. One of these is the law of conservation of mass.
