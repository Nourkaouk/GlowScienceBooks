Metals are usually shiny. The shine that we see when light reflects off the surface of a metal is called the lustre of the metal. We say metals are dense as their particles are packed close together. Metals conduct electricity and heat well. Metals are malleable (they can be shaped into flat sheets) and they are ductile (this means they can be made into thin wire). Most metals can be heated to high temperatures without melting or changing their shape, which is one of the reasons why pots and pans are made of metal. Metals are mined from the earth.
