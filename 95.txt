A homogeneous mixture (also known as solution) is a mixture in which the components cannot be seen by our naked eyes or using a microscope or a magnifying glass. A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition and properties throughout. It contains only one phase. A phase is a region with a uniform set of properties. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. For example, a mixture of sugar and water (sugar solution) is a homogeneous mixture because all the parts of the solution have the same sugar-water composition. The sugars are totally dispersed into the water and cannot be seen separately.
