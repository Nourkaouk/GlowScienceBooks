Newtonâ€™s third law of motion states that forces always come in pairs that act in opposite directions. For example, the Earth exerts a gravitational force on the Moon, and the Moon in turn exerts a gravitational force back on the Earth. As a more complicated example, consider the forces present when you are standing on the floor: There is a downward gravitational force acting on you. There is an upward gravitational force acting on the Earth. There is an upward normal force acting on you due to the floor. There is downward force acting on the floor due to you.
