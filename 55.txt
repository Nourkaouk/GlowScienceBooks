Our seas are also filled with animals of all shapes and sizes. Large mammals swim in our seas. The sea is also home to many species of fish. A group of fish is called a school of fish. The coral reefs off the South African coast, especially on the East coast, are very rich in fish and animal species. Where a river runs into the sea, a special area called an estuary develops. The fresh water from the river mixes with the salty sea water. You can often find mudskippers here (fish that can hop onto land and into trees!)
