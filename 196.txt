The cerebellum is crucial for smooth movements. It is a beautiful neuronal machine whose intricate cellular architecture has been mapped out in great detail. Like the basal ganglia, it is interconnected with the cortical areas concerned with motor control, and with brainstem structures. Damage to the cerebellum leads to poorly coordinated movements, loss of balance, slurred speech, and a number of cognitive difficulties. Alcohol has a powerful effect on the cerebellum. The cerebellum is vital for motor learning and adaptation. Almost all voluntary actions rely on fine control of motor circuits, and the cerebellum is important in their optimal adjustment.
