Main processes in the excretory system: 
1. Filtration: All the blood in the body passes through the kidneys as part of the circulatory system. The kidneys filter the blood to remove unwanted minerals and urea, and also excess water.
2. Absorption: Once the blood is filtered by the kidneys, the substances that the body needs are re-absorbed back into the blood. 
3. Diffusion: The substances are transported into and out of the specialised cells of the kidney through the process of diffusion. 
4. Excretion: The kidneys funnel the liquid urine through the ureters to the bladder where it is stored.
