Animals can't use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make food like plants do. Animals need to eat plants for energy to carry out their life processes. Living things that get their energy by eating either a plant or animal are called consumers. Many animals get their energy from eating plants. We call these animals herbivores. Some animals eat other animals to get energy. We call these animals carnivores. Other animals can eat plants and animals. We call these animals omnivores. We get special animals called scavengers and decomposers. They eat dead animals and break their bodies into tiny pieces.
