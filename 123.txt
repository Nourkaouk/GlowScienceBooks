This methodology is based on the well-known Bayes’ Theory of Probability. Several intermediate probabilities must be computed and evaluated. Bayes’ Theorem calculates the probability of giving a correct result (positive or negative) when it is indeed correct, P(a/p). This probability is called conditional probability, so many analyses are required to achieve a good uncertainty estimation or a better error probability. The main feature of this methodology is that, unlike Contingency Tables, the probability of giving a wrong result is estimated individually, because the conditional probability is calculated for each analysed sample. And only the same four parameters can be calculated.
