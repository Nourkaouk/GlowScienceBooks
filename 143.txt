The British engineering unit of power has no special name; it is simply a foot-pound per second (ft-lbf/sec). Another common unit that is not part of the British engineering system is the horsepower: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/sec, or about 745.7 watts. The power produced by an automobile engine is traditionally measured in horsepower. A few examples: Lawnmower: 5 hp, smart car: 90 hp, typical modern automobile engine: about 200 hp, 1967 Pontiac GTO “muscle car”: 360 hp, semi-truck (tractor): 500 hp, modern farm tractor: 500 hp, Formula One engine used in a modern Indianapolis 500 race car: 700 hp.
