The salt solution is a mixture because of the following main reasons: The components, salt and water, are simply physically mixed. This salt solution retains many of the properties of its constituents, sodium chloride and water. In other words, the salt solution shows the properties of the salt and the water. For example, the solution is colorless like water, and also it tastes salty like the original sodium chloride salt. The salt solution can be separated into salt and water by physical processes like evaporation or distillation. Therefore, all the above characteristics confirm that a salt solution is a mixture.
