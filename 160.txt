The climate system involves all the components of the Earth whose interactions control Earthâ€™s climate: The atmosphere (layer of gas around the Earth), the cryosphere (surface ice and snow, e.g. ice caps, glaciers), Hydrosphere (liquid surface waters, including groundwater), Lithosphere (rigid rocky outer layer of Earth), and Biosphere (all living things on Earth). Recent global warming calls to our attention the impact of human activities on climate. The anthropogenic influence on nature has become so great that it is nowadays adequate to define yet another component of the climate system: the anthroposphere (sum of all human activities influencing the environment).
