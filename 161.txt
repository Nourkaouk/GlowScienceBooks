The exact age of Earth cannot be determined directly but good approximation can be obtained by measuring the age of meteorites. Meteorites are rocks falling from space on the surface of the Earth. They originate primarily from the collision and fragmentation of asteroids. Asteroids are the leftover of the process of planetary accretion. The age of the Solar System (and the Earth) derived from meteorites is 4.6 billion years.
During the first billion years, the solar system was not yet cleared of the majority of its asteroids which means there was a higher probability of collision among asteroids and planets.
