The Plants and animals grow and develop throughout their lives. All the plants and animals need to make new plants or they will become extinct (no longer exist on earth). The adult plant or animal needs to reproduce offspring that will grow over time into a new adult that will reproduce offspring of its own. We call this a life cycle. It is a cycle because when a new plant or animal is made the cycle begins again. A plant or animal can die anywhere in its life cycle - at birth, as a young or old plant or animal.
