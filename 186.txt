Heroin is a man-made chemical derivative of the plant product morphine. Like cannabis, heroin hijacks a system in the brain that employs naturally occurring neurotransmitters known as endorphins. These are important in pain control - and so drugs that copy their actions are very valuable in medicine. Heroin is injected or smoked whereupon it causes immediate pleasurable sensation. It is highly addictive, but, as dependence develops, these pleasurable sensations quickly subside to be replaced by an incessant “craving”. It is a very dangerous drug that can kill in even modest overdose (suppresses breathing reflexes). Heroin has ruined many people’s lives.
