All the individuals of a species living within a specific area are called a population. For example, a forest may include many white pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of white pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A community is the set of populations inhabiting particular area. All of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forestâ€™s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem.
