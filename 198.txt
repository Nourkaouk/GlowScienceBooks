How well we learn is greatly influenced by our emotional state, we tend to remember events associated with particularly happy, sad or painful experiences. We learn better when we pay attention! These states of mind involve the release of neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline and steroid hormones such as cortisol (during novelty, stress and anxiety). Modulators have multiple actions on neurons, several of which act via changes in the functioning of NMDA receptors. Other actions include the activation of special genes specifically associated with learning. The proteins that they make help to stabilise LTP and make it last longer.
