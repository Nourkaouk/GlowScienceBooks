There are four main processes that occur in the digestive system. Ingestion: occurs when you take food into your body through your mouth by eating or drinking it.  Digestion: This is the process of breaking down large food pieces into particles that are small enough to be absorbed and pass through cell membranes. Absorption: This is when the digested particles move into the cells of the digestive tract and move to the bloodstream from where they are carried to all the cells in the body.  Egestion: undigested particles that travel through the digestive tract are later passed out as faeces.
