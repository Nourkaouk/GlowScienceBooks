The immune system is our first line of defence against malicious invaders. These invaders, viruses, and bacteria, range from common and mild, such as the all too familiar cold, to severe and life threatening, meningitis or tuberculosis. Our defences work in many ways. The first is locally within the tissue that is infected, injured or inflamed, causing swelling, changes in blood flow and release of local inflammatory molecules. More generally, activation of the immune system triggers cells called leucocytes and macrophages, and acute phase proteins that travel to the site of attack, to identify, kill and then remove invading pathogens.
