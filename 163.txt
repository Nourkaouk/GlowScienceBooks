A mineral is a naturally occurring solid inorganic substance composed of a regular 3D arrangement of atoms repeating in all directions. Each mineral can be identified with a chemical formula. A mineral growing freely form crystals whose external geometrical shape reflects the internal regular arrangement of atoms. The crystal structure of a mineral depends on its chemical composition. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which it formed. For example, graphite and diamond have the same chemical composition but they formed in very different conditions of pressure and temperature and therefore are characterized by very different crystal structures.
