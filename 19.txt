Did you know that the blood moving throughout your body forms a system? To "circulate" means to move around, and so we have the circulatory system within the human body which transports blood. The circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood with oxygen from the lungs to cells and then transporting blood with carbon dioxide back to the lungs. It also has to distribute nutrients from the digestive system to cells in the body and remove waste products to be excreted. The circulatory system is composed of the heart and a system of blood vessels, including arteries, veins and capillaries.
