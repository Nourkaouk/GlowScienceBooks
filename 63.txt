There is a feeding relationship between producers and consumers. We call this relationship a food chain. Plants are the producers. Animals are the consumers. A food chain describes how each living thing gets food and how energy is passed from one organism to the next. When we draw a food chain we use an arrow (→) between organisms to show that one eats the other and that energy is transferred from the one organism to the next. A simple food chain is: grass → cow → human→‰worms. Many food chains that are interdependent and linked are called a food web.
