Cytoskeleton: The cytoskeleton is a network of long fibers that make up the cellâ€™s structural framework. The cytoskeleton has several critical functions, including determining cell shape, participating in cell division, and allowing cells to move. It also provides a track-like system that directs the movement of organelles and other substances within cells. 
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): This organelle helps process molecules created by the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum also transports these molecules to their specific destinations either inside or outside the cell.
Golgi apparatus: The Golgi apparatus packages molecules processed by the endoplasmic reticulum to be transported out of the cell.
