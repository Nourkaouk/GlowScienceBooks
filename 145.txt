Many of the equations involving rotational motion of bodies involve the vector cross product. There are several different ways of multiplying one vector by another vector. There we examined one such type of multiplication, the dot product. Before we study rotational motion, weâ€™ll need to learn about another type of vector multiplication, the cross product. In the cross product, one multiplies a vector by another vector, and gets another vector back as the result (unlike the dot product, which returns a scalar result). Unlike the other two kinds of vector multiplication, the cross product is only defined for three-dimensional vectors.
