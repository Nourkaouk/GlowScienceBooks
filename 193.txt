Light enters the eye through the pupil and is focused, by the cornea and the lens, on to the retina at the back of the eye. The pupil is surrounded by a pigmented iris. It is natural to suppose that the eye acts like a camera, but this is a misleading metaphor. First, there is never a static image because the eyes are always moving. Second, even if an image on the retina were to send an image into the brain, “seeing” this next image would then need another person to look at it - a person inside the brain!
