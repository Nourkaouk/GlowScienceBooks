Physics’ goal is to learn how the Universe works at the most fundamental level—and to discover the basic laws by which it operates. Theoretical physics concentrates on developing the theory and mathematics of these laws, while applied physics focuses attention on the application of the principles of physics to practical problems. Experimental physics lies at the intersection of physics and engineering; experimental physicists have the theoretical knowledge of theoretical physicists, and they know how to build and work with scientific equipment. Physics is divided into several sub-fields, and physicists are trained to have some expertise in all of them.
