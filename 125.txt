The major fields of physics are: Classical mechanics is the study the motion of bodies according to Newton’s laws of motion. 
Electricity and magnetism are two closely related phenomena that are together considered a single field of physics. 
Quantum mechanics describes the peculiar motion of very small bodies.
Optics is the study of light.
Acoustics is the study of sound. 
Solid-state physics is the study of solids—most often crystalline metals. 
Plasma physics is the study of plasmas (ionized gases). 
Atomic, nuclear, and particle physics study of the atom, the atomic nucleus, and the particles that make up the atom.
