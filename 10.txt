Vacuoles in plant cells are usually quite large organelles that can occupy as much as 90% of the cell's volume. The liquid in the vacuole, called cell sap, helps to support the plant. The full vacuoles push out against the cell wall and make the cells, and the plant, rigid. We say the cells are turgid in this condition. The opposite to turgid is flaccid. When the vacuoles are full the plant's stem and leaves will be held upright and firm. Vacuoles are only present in some animal cells and they are typically very small and have a short life-span.
