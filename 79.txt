Ionic bonding is when positively and negatively charged ions stick to each other through electrostatic force. These bonds are slightly weaker than covalent bonds1 and stronger than Van der Waals bonding or hydrogen bonding. In ionic bonds the electronegativity of the negative ion is so much stronger than the electronegativity of the positive ion that the two ions do not share electrons. The more electronegative ion assumes full ownership of the electron(s). Sodium chloride forms crystals with cubic symmetry. The larger chloride ions are arranged in a cubic close-packing, while the smaller sodium ions fill the octahedral gaps between them.
