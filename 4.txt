All cells have some common structures. These are:  a cell membrane, cytoplasm; and in most eukaryotic cells, a nucleus. An organelle is a structure within the cell that performs a function for the cell. Examples of organelles in cells are vacuoles and mitochondria. All cells have a cell membrane around them. The cell membrane is a thin layer that encloses the cell's contents and separates the cell from its environment. Many different substances have to pass in and out of a cell for it to function. The cell membrane controls which substances are allowed to enter and leave the cell.
