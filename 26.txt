Our cells use oxygen and nutrients to function and in the process produce various metabolic waste products including: urea: substance that is formed when protein is broken down in the liver; carbon dioxide: by-product of cellular respiration. 
The organs of the excretory system are responsible for removing these harmful metabolic waste products from the blood so that they do not build up to high concentrations. But, they have to retain the nutrients and water for the body to function. One of the main functions of the excretory system is to prevent too much or too little water in the body.
