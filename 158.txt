Mars is red because of the widespread presence of iron oxide and iron hydroxide dust on its surface. These minerals form on Earth mainly by oxidation of iron-bearing silicates. There is very little free oxygen on Mars and the reaction of oxidation is very slow. However, there is evidence indicating that free oxygen may have been more abundant in the distant past of the planet. One hypothesis suggests that the temperature of Earth at the beginning of its formation was higher than that of Mars and that more iron oxide was melted and more elemental iron migrated toward Earthâ€™s core.
