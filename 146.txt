A double pendulum is formed by attaching one pendulum to the bob of another, so that the two pendulums are attached vertically and both bobs are free to move. The motion of double pendulum is a classic exercise in Lagrangian mechanics. A ballistic pendulum is a type of pendulum used to measure the speed of high-speed objects. A Foucault pendulum is a type of simple plane pendulum that is used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. As the pendulum swings back and forth in a plane, the Earth rotates underneath the pendulum, causing its trace to drift with time.
