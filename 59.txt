The plants need to have their seeds spread over a wide area. If all the seeds fall in one spot, the plants that grow will not have enough water, soil or sunlight to grow properly! That is why plants make their fruit sweet and tasty. Where the seeds fall they will then have a rich, fertile soil (from the animal excretion) to grow in! Other seeds stick to an animal's fur - they might not even know it's there! When they brush against a tree for example, the seed will just fall off. Plants depend on animals for seed dispersal.
