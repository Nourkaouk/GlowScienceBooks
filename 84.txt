Physical state is the form in which a substance is found under given conditions. The three physical states of matter are solid, liquid and gas. The same substance may exist in different states at different conditions. For example, water exists as a solid below 0o C, as a liquid between 0o C and 100o C, and as a vapor or gas above 100o C. Measurable physical properties are the properties of a substance that can be measured using an appropriate apparatus. These physical properties have constant values under specific conditions. Examples are melting point, boiling point, density and electrical conductivity.
