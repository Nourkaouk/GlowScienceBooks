Systems of Units: Several different systems of units are in common use. For everyday civil use, most of the world uses metric units. The United Kingdom uses both metric units and an imperial system. Here in the United States, U.S. customary units are most common for everyday use. There are actually several “metric” systems in use. They can be broadly grouped into two categories: those that use the meter, kilogram, and second as base units (MKS systems), and those that use the centimeter, gram, and second as base units (CGS systems). There is only one MKS system, called SI units.
