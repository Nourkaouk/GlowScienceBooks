The chemical element with the highest density is osmium. There has been some debate about whether osmium or iridium is the densest element, and the densities of the two are very close. But calculations show that for a perfect crystalline sample of each element, the density of osmium is 22.59 g/cm3, while that of iridium is 22.56 g/cm3, making osmium the winner by a small margin.
The chemical element with the lowest density is hydrogen, with a density of 0.0899 g/cm3 at standard temperature and pressure. But excluding gases, the lightest element is lithium, with a density of 0.534 g/cm3.
