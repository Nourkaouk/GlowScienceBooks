Gene variants can be inherited from a parent or occur during a person’s lifetime: Inherited variants are passed from parent to child and are present throughout person’s life in virtually every cell in the body. These variants are also called germline variants because they are present in the parent’s egg or sperm cells, which are also called germ cells. When an egg and a sperm cell unite, the resulting fertilized egg cell contains DNA from both parents. Any variants that are present in that DNA will be present in the cells of the child that grows from the fertilized egg.
