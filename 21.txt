Common diseases of the circulatory system: High Blood Pressure: This occurs when the force with which the blood pushes against the walls of the blood vessels is too high and can cause damage to the capillaries and organs. Heart Attacks: Occur when a narrowing or blood clot develops in one of the blood vessels that supplies the heart muscle with blood. Strokes: Occur when cells in your brain are deprived of oxygen. This often occurs as a result of a blockage in the blood vessels leading to the brain, or when one of these vessels rupture (break or burst open).
