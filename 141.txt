Energy is one of the most important concepts in all of physics, although itâ€™s a bit difficult to define exactly. Units for energy are the same as the units of work: joules in SI units, ergs in CGS units, and foot pounds in British engineering units. Another common (non-SI) unit of energy is the electron volt (eV). This is a small unit of energy, commonly used in atomic, nuclear, particle, and plasma physics. It is defined as the amount of energy gained by accelerating an electric charge equal to the electron charge through an electric potential difference of 1 volt.
