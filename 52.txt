A second type of microscope used in laboratories is the dissecting microscope. These microscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and can provide a three-dimensional view. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue structure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting microscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens systems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to make manipulations by hand easier.
