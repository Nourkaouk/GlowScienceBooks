If a piece of paper is burned in air, two observable products are formed: an ash and a smoke. These substances have different properties and composition from the original material. After burning, the composition of the sample is changed because it no longer exists as a paper. Such type of change that results in the formation of new substances with new properties and composition is known as a chemical change. A chemical change is a chemical property of a substance. Some common examples of chemical changes are digestion of food, growth of plants, burning of wood, and exploding of gunpowder.
