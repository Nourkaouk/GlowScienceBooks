When we combine materials, new materials are made. The properties of the new materials are often different from the properties of the materials we started with. There are many ways to process existing materials into new materials. There are also many reasons why we would need to process materials into new materials. When we bake a cake, we are processing flour, eggs and other ingredients into cake which tastes good! We process materials to make them stronger, or more durable, or even just to make them look more beautiful. New materials that form after mixing different materials are called mixtures.
