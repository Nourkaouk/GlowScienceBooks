All animal and plant cells are enclosed or surrounded by a cell membrane as we learned before. However, as you probably noticed in the previous activity, animal cells often have an irregular shape, whereas plant cells have a much more regular shape. Plant cells have an additional layer surrounding the cell on the outside of the cell membrane. This is called the cell wall. This wall provides a protective framework for support and stability for the plant cell. The cell wall is formed from various compounds, the main one being cellulose. Cellulose helps maintain the shape of the plant cell.
