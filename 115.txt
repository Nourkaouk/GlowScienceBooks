The advantages of the periodic table can be summarized as follows: The periodic table is useful in predicting the properties of elements. If an element is known to be in a certain group of which the group properties are known, its properties can be predicted from group properties. For example, Francium, an extremely unstable element, is found in Group IA. Thus, the chemical properties of Francium would be similar to the properties of Group IA elements. The periodic table is useful to predict new elements. From the periodic table you can read, deduce and state basic information about given element.
