Electromagnetic force: Most forces you encounter in everyday life (besides gravity) are electromagnetic in nature. When you push on something with your hand, for example, you are not really in direct contact with it: the outermost electrons of the atoms at the surface of the object are being electrically repelled by the outermost electrons in the atoms at the surface of your hand. Similarly, when you’re standing on the floor, you’re actually hovering a small distance above the floor: the outermost electrons at the bottom of your shoes are electrically repelling the outermost electrons at the top of the floor.
