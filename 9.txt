Chloroplasts: You might remember learning about photosynthesis in previous grades. Can you still remember why photosynthesis is so important to all life on earth? Did you notice the green organelles present in plant cells which were not there in the animal cells in the previous activity? These are chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are the only cell organelles that can produce food from the sun's energy. Only plants with chloroplasts are able to photosynthesise because they contain the very important green pigment, chlorophyll. Chlorophyll can absorb radiant energy from the sun and convert this to chemical energy that plants and animals can use.
