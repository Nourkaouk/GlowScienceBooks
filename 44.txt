Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds, which allow ions and polar molecules to dissolve in water. Water is an excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules give water the ability to hold heat better than other substances. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water break and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to remain stable, although increased energy is added to the system. Waterâ€™s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension. All of these properties of water are important in chemistry.
