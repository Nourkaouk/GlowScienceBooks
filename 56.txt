Many animals live in or near freshwater ponds, dams and lakes, rivers and streams. These include small insects, snails, clams, crabs, frogs and fish. Larger animals like turtles, snakes, ducks and large fish, as well as hippos and crocodiles also live in or near water. Water plants make oxygen for the animals to breathe and provide food for many of the animals to eat. In South Africa we also have large wetlands where rivers slow down and the water stands still or flows very slowly. Wetlands provide food and shelter and a natural habitat for an incredible amount of animals.
