A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA. Some genes act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. However, many genes do not code for proteins. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million. An international research effort called the Human Genome Project, which worked to determine the sequence of human genome and identify the genes that it contains, estimated that humans have between 20,000 and 25, 000 genes. Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent.
