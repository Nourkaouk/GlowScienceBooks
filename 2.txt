Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms. You cannot see individual cells with the naked eye, because they are too small - you need to use a microscope to be able to see cells. We say cells are microscopic because they can only be seen under a microscope. Robert Hooke was the first cytologist to identify cells under his microscope in 1665. He decided to call the microscopic shapes that he saw in a slice of cork "cells" because the shapes reminded him of the cells that the monks in the nearby monastery lived in.
