Acids are substances that release hydrogen ion in water solution. The characteristic properties of acids are due to the presence of hydrogen ions. Acids are found in nature or can be prepared in the laboratory. Acids have a sour taste. Vinegar, lemon, and spoilt milk all taste sour due to the presence of acids. For example, fruits like lemon and orange contain citric acid and vinegar contains acetic acid. Carbonic acid formed from carbondioxide dissolved in water is present in some of the soft drinks. Hydrochloric acid, which helps in the digestion of food, is also present in our body.
