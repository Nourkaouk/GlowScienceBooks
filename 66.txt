The gestation stage in an animal's life is the time before the embryo is born. Animals produce young in different ways: Born alive: some animals grow inside the womb of the mother animal and are then born alive. Hatched from eggs: the mother animal lays eggs and the embryo develops inside the egg before it hatches. Hatched from eggs inside the mother animal's body and are then born alive: the embryo develops within an egg inside the mother animal's body. The eggs can hatch just before or after birth. After the animal is born or hatched, they grow and change.
