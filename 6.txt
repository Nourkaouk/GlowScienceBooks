DNA is a very important part of all cells and therefore of all life. DNA contains information that encodes all our inherited traits. This refers to characteristics which are passed down in families, such as your skin and eye colour, whether you have allergies and also the likelihood of contracting different types of illnesses. Every organism has unique DNA. The difference in DNA that occurs between individuals is called variation. Even the slightest difference in DNA might cause significant variations within species and between species. Within species DNA differences can lead to albino animals or the transference of similar illnesses.
