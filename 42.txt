Paleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study lifeâ€™s history. Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas. Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products. Ecologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments. Physiologists study the workings of cells, tissues and organs. This is just a small sample of the fields that biologists can pursue. From our own bodies to the world we live in, discoveries in biology can affect us in very direct and important ways.
