Mendeleev’s periodic law state that “the properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic masses”. According to his table when the elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic masses, there is a regular repetition in chemical and physical properties. Therefore, elements with similar properties fall in the same group. Mendeleev had the idea of arranging ‘families’ of elements that have similar properties in vertical columns or groups. Mendeleev’s classification was a great improvement. He grouped the elements more accurately based on their properties. Also, he was able to predict the existence and the properties of some elements.
