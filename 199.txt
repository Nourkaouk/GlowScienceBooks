Long-term memory is also sub-divided into different systems located in widely dispersed networks of the brain. The different networks do very different jobs. Broadly speaking, information enters sensory systems and then passes down pathways that provide increasingly specialised processing. For example, information entering the visual system passes down a so-called ventral pathway from the striate cortex to the medial temporal lobe through a cascade of networks that work out shape, colour, object dentity, whether the object is familiar or not, until finally, some kind of memory is formed of this particular object and when and where it has been seen.
