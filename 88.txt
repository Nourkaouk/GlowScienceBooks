All metals are solids at room temperature except mercury which is a liquid. They have high melting points and boiling points. Some examples of metals are gold, iron, silver, copper, aluminium, sodium and lead. Non metals are elements that are not shiny, and are non-conductors of heat and electricity. They are not malleable and ductile. Non metals generally exist as solids or gases at room temperature. Bromine is the only a non-metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Non metals have relatively, low melting points and boiling points. Carbon, sulphur, flourine and phosphorous are some common examples of nonmetals.
