The most successful attempt to classify elements was put forward by a Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev in 1869. When he arranged the known 65 elements in order of increasing atomic masses, he observed that elements with similar properties appeared at regular (periodic) intervals. This is known as periodicity. An occurrence that is repeated in a regular way is said to be periodic. The very reactive metals lithium, sodium and potassium occur at regular intervals. They have similar properties and can be described as a ‘family’. Mendeleev described the periodic repetition of the properties of the elements as the periodic law.
