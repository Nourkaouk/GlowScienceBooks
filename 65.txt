In flowering plants, the life cycle begins when a seed germinates. Look at the diagram showing the seed after it has germinated. The seed germinates when a small root (radicle) and stem start to grow out of the seed. This grows into a young plant. The germinates, grows and develops into a seedling. In time the seedling grows and matures into a young adult plant that is bigger. The young adult plant continues to grow until it becomes a mature adult plant. The adult plant can reproduce using flowers that produce seeds. The plant reaches maturity when it makes flowers.
