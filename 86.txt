For example, a block of iron is a pure substance containing only one kind of component. Water is also a pure substance containing two components combined chemically in a definite ratio. Some other examples of pure substances are oxygen, copper, gold, and carbondioxide. Rock salt is another example. It contains varying amounts of sodium chloride and rock. In rock salt, sodium chloride and sand have their properties. The proportion of sodium chloride and sand is not also uniform throughout the sample. This type of substance is called a mixture. Mixtures are combinations of two or more components in varying proportions.
