Common diseases of the digestive system include : Ulcers: Sometimes open sores or ulcers develop on the lining of the mouth, oesophagus, stomach or upper portions of the small intestine. They are generally caused by bacterial infections and some medications. Anorexia nervosa: People who suffer from eating disorder have an abnormal fear of gaining weight and therefore starve themselves on purpose. This can lead to many health issues. Diarrhoea: Someone who passes very frequent, loose, watery stools has diarrhoea. Many diseases cause undigested food to pass through the large intestines too quickly for water to be absorbed and cause diarrhoea.
