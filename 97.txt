The substances in our environment constantly change. The decay of plants and animals, the burning of gasoline, and the melting of snow are some of the changes that occur in our environment. Most of the changes in substances are classified into physical and chemical changes. Changes that do not alter the composition of the substances are called physical changes. In physical changes, the original substance can be recovered or the change can easily be reversed. Changes like melting, freezing, and dissolving are physical changes. This is because in all of these changes new substances with new properties are not formed.
