Each different shell is subdivided into one or more orbitals, which also have different energy levels, although the energy difference between orbitals is less than the energy difference between shells. Longer wavelengths have less energy; the s orbital has the longest wavelength allowed for an electron orbiting a nucleus and this orbital is observed to have the lowest energy. Each orbital has characteristic shape which shows where electrons most often exist. The orbitals are named using letters of the alphabet. In order of increasing energy, the orbitals are s, p, d, and f orbitals. The shells are designated by numbers.
