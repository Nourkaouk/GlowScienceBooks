Given our desire to avoid sources of pain, such as the dentist, you might imagine that a life without pain would be good. Not so. One of the key functions of pain is to enable us to learn to avoid situations that give rise to pain. Action potentials in the nociceptive nerves entering the spinal cord initiate automatic protective reflexes, such as the withdrawal reflex. They also provide very information that guides learning to avoid dangerous or threatening situations.
Another key function of pain is the inhibition of activity - the rest that allows healing to occur after tissue damage.
