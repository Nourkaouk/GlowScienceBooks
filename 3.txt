Your body is made up of many different kinds of cells. We say your cells are specialised to perform a specific function. Depending on the function of the cell, it can be specialised by having different shape or size or may have some components which other cells do not have. Have a look at the differences between nerve cells and red blood cells in the images. Even though there are many different types of cells, there are components of the cell structure which are common to all cells. There are also some structures which most, but not all, cells have.
