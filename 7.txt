Do you remember that we spoke about food as the energy source for our bodies? Just as wood is burned to use the stored potential energy to make a fire to heat some water, the food that we eat needs to be broken down to release the energy so that our bodies can function. Mitochondria are responsible for doing this. Mitochondria are organelles enclosed by a double membrane. Very active cells would typically have more mitochondria than cells that are less active. Which type of cell, do you think, will have more mitochondria: a muscle cell or a bone cell?
