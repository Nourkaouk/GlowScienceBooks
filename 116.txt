One of the trends in modern analytical chemistry is the development of new analytical techniques and methods that can reliably identify and quantify the components in complicated samples such as those related to environmental problems or food protection. Hyphenated techniques such as the combination of chromatography with mass spectrometry or various spectroscopic techniques are just some of the examples of these developments. These powerful tools have involved considerable investment in expensive instruments and require analysts to be properly trained. However, from a practical point of view, many users find it increasingly important to reconsider whether quantitative results are really necessary.
