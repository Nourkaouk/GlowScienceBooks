One cell organisms that can only be seen with the help of a microscope is microscopic organisms. There are many single-celled microscopic organisms. They are visible to the naked eye and consist of many cells. Macroscopic organisms can have few cells working together or trillions of cells that form larger organisms. In microscopic single-celled organisms, the individual cell has to perform all the life processes for that microscopic organism. What about the cells in macroscopic organisms that consist of many cells? we know that not all cells perform all the processes - they are specialised to perform a specific function.
