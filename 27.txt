Components of the excretory system
The urinary system consists of four parts:
 1. Kidneys: The kidneys filter all the blood in your body to remove urea from the blood. Your kidneys produce urine which is a combination of excess water and waste products. 2. Ureters: There are two ureters which connect each kidney with the bladder and carry the urine from the kidney to the bladder.3. Bladder: The bladder is a balloon-like organ that collects the urine before excreting it during urination. 4. Urethra: The urethra is a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the human body.
