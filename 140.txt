Classical physics has, since the Renaissance, recognized six basic simple machines. All other machines in use today may be considered as combinations of two or more of these simple machines. The simple machines are: inclined plane, wheel and axle, pulley, lever, wedge, screw. Each of these simple machines allows work to be performed with less effort, by trading off effort (applied force) for distance. Recall that work is the product of force and distance: W D F x, so that the same amount of work W may be accomplished by applying a smaller force F over a greater distance x.
