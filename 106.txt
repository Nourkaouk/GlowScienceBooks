An atom contains three fundamental sub atomic particles: proton, electron, and neutron. An atom has a definite number of protons, electrons, and neutrons. The structure of the atom describes how these particles are arranged. An atom has two regions: the atomic nucleus and the orbits. The nucleus of an atom contains neutrons and protons. Electrons revolve in shells around the nucleus like planets move around the sun. Each electron is located at a certain distance from the nucleus. Almost all the mass of an atom is concentrated in the nucleus. Hence the nucleus is a heavy part of an atom.
