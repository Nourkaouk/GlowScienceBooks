Properties are the characteristics that give a substance its identity and enable us to distinguish one kind of substance from another. No two substances have exactly the same set of properties. To identify a substance, chemists observe two distinct types of properties: physical and chemical properties. Physical properties are the characteristics a substance shows without changing into a new substance. These properties are perceived by our sense organs or measured without changing the identity of the substance. Chemical properties are characteristics that describe the ability of a substance to form new substance. Example of chemical properties is rusting of iron.
