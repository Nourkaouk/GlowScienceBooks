Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons are called Isotopes. Isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, there are three isotopes of carbon. The first isotope contains 6 neutrons. The second contains 7 and the third contains 8 neutrons. In their designation, the mass number is written with a hyphen after the name of the element. For example, isotopes of carbon with mass numbers 12, 13 and 14 can be written as Carbon–12, Carbon–13 and Carbon–14 respectively. Alternately as 12C, 13C and 14C.
