Organisation of cells in macroscopic organisms: Specialised cells that perform a specific function, group together to form a tissue. For example, muscle cells will group together to form muscle tissue, epithelial cells will group together to form the skin, and nerve cells will group together to form the brain and nerves. Groups of tissues that work together form organs. Think of the stomach for example - it is made of many different specialised cells that form muscle tissue to make it contract and epithelial tissue (made from specialised epithelial cells) which lines the inside of the stomach and produces mucus.
