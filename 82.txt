Natural science is the study of nature and natural laws. It includes fields such as chemistry, biology, physics and geology. These fields of study in natural science are closely interrelated. There are no distinct boundaries between them. Chemistry and biology are closely related branches of natural science. For example, biology and chemistry are integrated in biochemistry which studies the chemical composition, structure and the reactions of compounds found in living organisms. Chemistry and physics are also overlapping physical sciences. They make use of the same laws of nature to gain a better understanding of the properties and behavior of matter.
