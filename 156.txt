Several observations must be explained when one wants to understand how the Moon formed: Earth is the only inner planet of the solar system with a large moon. The orbital plane of the Moon does not coincide with the orbital plane of the Earth around the Sun or with the Earth’s equatorial plane. The Moon has a small iron core compared to the inner planets. The Moon is much less dense (3.3 g/cm3 ) than Earth (5.5 g/cm3 ). The Moon’s density is close to that of the Earth’s mantle. There are very little light, volatile elements on the Moon.
