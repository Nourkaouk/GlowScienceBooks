Liquid water could occur on Mars today beneath the surface where temperature is higher due to the Planet’s internal heat. A “frozen sea” covered with what looks like rafts of sea ice lying beneath a layer of Martian dust was discovered a few years ago near the equator. Scientists think that the water composing this frozen sea came from a water-rich layer occurring underground and reached the surface a few million years ago for an unknown reason. The water quickly froze upon reaching the surface and was covered by dust. The dust layer prevents the ice from disappearing by sublimation.
