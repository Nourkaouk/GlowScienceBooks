There were several attempts to classify the elements based on similarities in properties. Scientists tried to classify the known elements to make their study easy. Law of Triads: The first serious attempt to classify elements was made by the German scientist Dobereiner. Dobereiner arranged similar elements in a group of three or triads in increasing order of their atomic masses. Then, he observed that the atomic mass of the middle element is nearly equal to the average atomic mass of the other two elements. But, the law of triads was not satisfactory for all the elements known at that time.
