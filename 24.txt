All the movements that your body performs rely on a system of muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones and joints that work together. The purpose of the musculoskeletal system: Muscle tissue is responsible for producing movement in the body, however muscles need to be attached to a frame structure to produce movement. The bones of the skeleton provide a frame for muscles to attach to, so that movement is possible. The skeleton also protects the body, especially the soft, fragile organs like the heart, lungs and brain. The components of the musculoskeletal: 1. Muscles 2. Bones 3. Cartilage 4. Tendons 5. Ligaments.
