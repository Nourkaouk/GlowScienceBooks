Stem cells are unspecialised cells which can divide and develop into many different types of specialised cells. Stem cells are quite amazing as they can divide and multiply while at the same time keeping their ability to develop into any other type of cell. Embryonic stem cells are the little ball of 50 -150 cells that forms 4-5 days after conception. Embryonic stem cells are very special as they can become absolutely any cell in the body, for example, blood cells, nerve cells, muscle cells or brain cells. For this reason, scientists are using stem cells to conduct their research.
