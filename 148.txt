The fluid can be treated as though it had no viscosity, resulting in frictionless flow. Such a fluid is called an ideal fluid. The flow of ideal fluid can be incompressible or compressible; it is neither laminar nor turbulent. Flow in piping may be laminar, transitional, or turbulent. Laminar flow is characterized by a parabolic velocity profile having a centerline velocity equal to two times the average. Flow is very orderly and there is no radial or tangential movement. Behavior is predictable with little uncertainty as long as the fluid viscosity is Newtonian: i.e. constant, and independent of sheer rate.
