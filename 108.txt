Proton: A proton is a tiny positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. Protons are too small to see, even with a powerful microscope. If an atom has the size of a football stadium, then a proton would be smaller than a marble or a pea. All elements have the same type of protons. A proton of the carbon atom, for example, is the same as the protons found in the oxygen and aluminum atoms. Thus, all protons are exactly the same. One element differs from another element in the number of protons contained in its atoms.
