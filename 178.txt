Epigenetics is the study of how cells control gene activity without changing the DNA sequence. "epigenetic" describes factors beyond the genetic code. Epigenetic changes are modifications to DNA that regulate whether genes are turned on or off. These modifications are attached to DNA and do not change the sequence of DNA building blocks. Within the complete set of DNA in a cell (genome), all of the modifications that regulate the activity (expression) of the genes is known as the epigenome. Because epigenetic changes help determine whether genes are turned on or off, they influence the production of proteins in cells.
