Venus is characterized by an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96% of CO2, the 4% left being primarily sulfuric acid and other gasses including water vapor. Due to its thick atmosphere, 80% of the incoming solar radiation is reflected back to space. However, the greenhouse effect due to the extremely high concentration of CO2 is so intense that the surface temperature is maintained at a staggering 460 ºC. Venus is tectonically active and littered with volcanoes. One hypothesis is that intense convection movements in the Planet’s interior generate many cracks at the surface breaking up the thin crust into flakes.
