The Earth is thought to have been in a molten state at the beginning of its history. The primary sources of heat were: 1. The impacts of meteorites and large planetesimals (conversion of kinetic energy). 2. Radioactive decay (still a source of heat today). 3. Gravitational contraction (the “bicycle pump effect”). The molten state of the Earth meant that matter could move around and redistribute according to its density. Heavier components sank toward the center of Earth whereas lighter components remained closer to the surface. This process is called gravitational differentiation and is responsible for the formation of Earth’s layers.
