The fields of cross-disciplinary physics combine physics with other sciences. These include astrophysics (physics of astronomy), geophysics (physics of geology), biophysics (physics of biology), chemical physics (physics of chemistry), and mathematical physics. Besides acquiring a knowledge of physics for its own sake, the study of physics will give you a broad technical background and set of problem-solving skills that you can apply to wide variety of other fields. Some students of physics go on to study more advanced physics, while others find ways to apply their knowledge of physics to such diverse subjects as mathematics, engineering, biology, medicine, and finance.
