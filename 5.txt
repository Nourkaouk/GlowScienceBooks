Plant and animal cells have a nucleus inside the cytoplasm. It controls all the processes and chemical reactions that take place inside the cell. The nucleus also contains the cell's genetic material which is organised into long DNA molecules The nucleus is structured as follows:  A double membrane called the nuclear membrane encloses the DNA. This membrane contains pores for substances to pass through.  There is a nucleolus inside the nucleus. This is often seen as darker area within the nucleus.  The DNA contains information about inherited characteristics, such as whether the person will have blue, brown or green eyes.
