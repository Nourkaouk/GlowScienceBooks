Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of total) are slightly different between people. Alleles are forms of the same gene with small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These small differences contribute to each personâ€™s unique physical features. Scientists keep track of genes by giving them unique names. Because gene names can be long, genes are also assigned symbols, which are short combinations of letters (sometimes numbers) that represent an abbreviated version of the gene name. Genes are made up of DNA. Each chromosome contains many genes.
