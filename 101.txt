Law of Conservation of Mass: Chemical reactions take place according to the “laws of chemical reaction or chemical combination”. One of these laws is law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation of mass states that in all chemical reactions the total mass of the reactants is equal to that of the products. This means atoms cannot be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Hence mass is conserved during a chemical reaction. The law of conservation of mass is known as the law of conservation of atoms. The law of conservation of mass can be verified by experiments.
