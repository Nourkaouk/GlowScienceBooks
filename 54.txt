Thousands of different animals and plants live in or near water in aquatic habitats. There are two main kinds of aquatic habitats - marine (saltwater) habitats and freshwater habitats. The plants and animals that live in these habitats are adapted to either live in salt water or in fresh water. In South Africa there are examples of both types of aquatic habitats. Our country has a very long coastline with many different types of habitats. For example, many animals live in and around the rock pools. They have to withstand the harsh sun and the constant pounding of the waves.
