The main points of Daltonâ€™s atomic theory are: Matter consists of very small particles called atoms. Atoms are indivisible. All atoms of a given element are identical, they have the same mass and properties. Atoms of one element are different from atoms of other elements in mass and other properties.
 A chemical reaction involves only the separation, combination, or rearrangement of atoms; it does not result in their creation or destruction. Atoms combine in a fixed small whole-number ratio to form compounds. For example, in carbondioxide one atom of carbon combines with 2 atoms of oxygen, in the ratio 1:2.
