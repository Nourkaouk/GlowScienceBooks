Metals are (mostly): solid and strong; malleable and ductile (this means they can be hammered or bent into different shapes); shiny or silvery (lustrous), especially when they are new; and cold to touch. Non-metals: can be soft or flexible, like rubber; can be hard and brittle, like glass; do not have a silvery (lustrous) appearance, but tend to be dull; can be grouped into different categories (ceramics, wood, rubber, plastic, glass etc.); and usually feels neither cold nor hot. Every type of matter has its own set of properties. "Shiny", "brittle", "malleable", "dense" are all examples of properties of materials.
