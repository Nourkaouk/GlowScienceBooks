The study of rocks can help solving environmental issues. For instance, plans to store carbon dioxide within certain rock formations with the purpose to alleviate the current rise in global temperature are now being evaluated by experts. The storage of highly radioactive waste deep underground is considered a relatively safe way to dispose of this dangerous material. Drinking water is fundamental resource for all countries in the world. The presence or absence of groundwater reservoirs and their characteristics is determined by rock properties. The study of rocks is therefore essential for the localization, characterization, and sustainable exploitation of groundwater reservoirs.
