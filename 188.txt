Embedded in the dermal layers of the skin, beneath the surface, are several types of tiny receptors. Named after the scientists who first identified them in microscope, Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles, Merkelâ€™s disks and Ruffini endings sense different aspects of touch. All these receptors have ion channels that open in response to mechanical deformation, triggering action potentials that can be recorded experimentally by fine electrodes. Some amazing experiments were conducted some years ago by scientists who experimented on themselves, by inserting electrodes into their own skin to record from single sensory nerves. From these and similar experiments in anaesthetised animals.
