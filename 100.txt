Most of the substances around us exist in the form of mixtures. However, these mixtures can be separated into pure substances using various separation techniques. The methods used to separate mixtures are mainly physical processes. This is because the substances in a mixture are physically combined. The methods used to separate mixtures are filtration, evaporation, magnetic separation, decantation and distillation. Note that the methods for the separation of mixtures depend on the differences in the density, melting point, boiling point, solubility, etc. In a mixture of salt solution, if we need to separate only the salt, evaporation can be used.
