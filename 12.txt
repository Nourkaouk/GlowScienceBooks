Microscopic and Macroscopic organisms: We have just looked at specialised cells within organisms. The organisms that we discussed, plants and animals, consist of many, many cells. Your body has millions of cells! Did you know that there are some organisms which consist of only a single cell? We have many different specialised cells to perform the different functions within our body whereas in a single-celled organism, all the functions it performs are done in this one cell. We can make a distinction between organisms that are made of one cell (unicellular) and those that are made of many cells (multicellular).
