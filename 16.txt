The digestive system: Our cells need protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals to function. Yet we eat large pieces of food that are too big to pass through the selectively permeable cell membranes. So how does the food we eat eventually get to our cells in a small enough form to be absorbed? Our digestive system is responsible for breaking down the food that we eat into small particles that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. They are then transported to the cells throughout our body. The digestive system is made up of the different parts of the alimentary canal.
