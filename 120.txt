The Unreliability region: In quantitative analysis, the uncertainty is the numerical value related to the interval in which the measurand may be found with a given probability. However, for qualitative methods, having binary responses of the YES/NO type, there is no meaning for a number associated with the result and expressed as a semi-interval that is attached to it, so uncertainty is expressed not as a numerical value but as a region of probabilities of committing error. Moreover, following the nomenclature used until now, it corresponds to the region in which false responses are obtained (either false positive or negative).
