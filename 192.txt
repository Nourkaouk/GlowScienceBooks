Humans are highly visual animals constantly using their eyes to make decisions about the world. With forward facing eyes like other primates, we use vision to sense those many aspects of the environment that are remote from our bodies. Light is a form of electromagnetic energy that enters our eyes where it acts on photoreceptors in the retina. This triggers processes by which neural impulses are generated and then travel through the pathways and networks of the visual brain. Separate pathways to the midbrain and the cerebral cortex mediate different visual functions - detecting and representing motion, shape, colour etc.
