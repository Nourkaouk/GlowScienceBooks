Atoms are extremely small and their masses cannot be described using ordinary mass units, such as grams, milligrams. A different scale is used to describe the mass of atomic particles. We use “relative mass” to describe their mass. The relative mass of atomic particles is expressed in atomic mass unit (amu). The mass of a proton is not the same as that of a neutron. But according to the relative mass scale they are both assigned a relative mass of 1 amu. The mass of an electron is extremely small as compared to that of the proton and the neutron.
