A forest is a large area that is mostly covered in trees. Forests are extremely important to life on earth. The many trees clean the air and provide oxygen for the animals on earth to breathe. They also provide people with food and shelter, medicine and employment. Many animals live in forests, from large elephants and bears to smaller monkeys, and woodpeckers. We need to conserve our forests and stop people who want to chop down naturally growing trees. It is very important to also conserve the many animals that help pollinate trees and spread their seeds over large areas.
