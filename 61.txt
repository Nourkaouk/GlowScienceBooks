Plants do not eat in the same way humans do. They make their own food inside their little "factories". They do this through a process called photosynthesis: They absorb water and nutrients through their roots. The water travels to the leaf or stem where the plants make the food. The plants also carbon dioxide (a gas) from the air. They also use energy from the sun for this process. The plants use the water and carbon dioxide gas with the sunlight energy to make food in the form of sugars. Oxygen is given off as a by-product of this process.
