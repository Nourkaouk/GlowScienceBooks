We know that matter exists in three physical states or forms: solid, liquid and gaseous states. By varying the temperature, substances can be changed from one physical state to another. Such type of a change is a physical change. Letâ€™s take water as an example. Water exists in solid, liquid and gaseous states. When ice is heated, it melts to liquid water, and on further heating the water changes to steam. Liquid water looks different from ice or steam. But the composition and identity of the original substance does not change because it is still water whatever its state is.
