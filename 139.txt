Friction is a resistive force between two solid bodies in contact that inhibits the motion of the objects. Friction is a force that always acts opposite the direction of motion of the object. Experimentally, we find that the frictional force f is proportional to the normal force. Traditionally physicists describe three types of frictional force: static, kinetic, and rolling friction. Static friction is at work when the object is stationary; kinetic friction is at work when the object is in motion; and rolling friction applies to rolling bodies. Under controlled conditions, experiments show that the two tend to become indistinguishable.
