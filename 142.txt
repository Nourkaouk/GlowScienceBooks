One of the most important laws in physics is called the law of conservation of energy. It states that, if you add up all the energy in a system in all its forms (giving the total energy E), that total energy will not change with time. Energy may be converted from one form to another, but the total energy will remain constant as long as the system is closed (i.e. no energy enters or leaves the system). The conservation of energy is not only an important physical principle, but it can be used as a shortcut in solving certain problems.
