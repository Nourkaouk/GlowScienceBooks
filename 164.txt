Rocks provide information about the origin and evolution of the terrestrial biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere during the past 4.6 billion years. The study of rocks is not limited to our planet. By analyzing meteorites, rocks fallen from the sky, we can learn about the origin of the solar system. Samples of Moon rocks and soil have been collected during the Appolo missions and by the Russian Luna spacecrafts in the late 60s and early 70s. More recently, NASA rovers analyze Martian rocks to unravel the history of the red planet and to seek traces of present and past life.
