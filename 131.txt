Most substances are more dense in the solid state than they are in the liquid state, so as they freeze, the frozen parts sink. An important exception is water, which has its maximum density at 4 C in the liquid state. Frozen water (ice) is less dense than liquid water, so the frozen parts float. Aquatic life is able to survive freezing temperatures because ice floats to the top of bodies of water, forming a layer of ice that insulates the water below. If ice were denser than water, lakes and rivers would freeze solid and destroy most aquatic life.
