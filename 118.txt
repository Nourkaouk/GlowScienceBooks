The idea of qualitative method is by no means new. It has been defined by the European Community as “ the assessment of the presence or absence of one or more analytes in a sample due to its physical and chemical properties”. AOAC defines qualitative methods as a “method of analysis whose response is either the presence or absence of the analyte, detected either directly or indirectly in a certain amount of a sample”. It can be concluded from the definitions that a qualitative analytical method is used to find out if a sample contains one or more specific analytes.
