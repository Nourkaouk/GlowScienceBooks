Electron: Is there any relationship between “electron” and “electricity”? An electron is a tiny negatively charged particle found outside the nucleus. They are about 2000 times smaller than a proton. Since electrons are found outside the nucleus they are always available at the surface an atom. When you rub materials together, static electricity is observed because of electrons on the surface of the materials. In a given atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. For instance, an oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 electrons an atom of aluminum has 13 protons and 13 electrons.
