Common diseases of the excretory system: 
Kidney Failure: the kidney loses its ability to properly filter and remove metabolic waste which allows this waste to build up in the body. This is very harmful and may be fatal. In such cases the patient needs to undergo very regular kidney dialysis. Dialysis involves using a machine which filters the blood for the patient to remove waste products. 
ladder infection: This is one of the most common infections in women but is quite rare in men. Bacteria can enter the bladder and cause an infection. This causes swelling and pain when urinating.
