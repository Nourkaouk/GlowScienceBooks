Contingency tables are based on the calculation of probability. Although other formats are possible, the most commonly used are those that give two-category classification: positive or negative, above or below a regulatory concentration level, etc. Then, the qualitative method result is compared with the results obtained using the confirmatory method. From this table, it is possible to calculate only four performance parameters (false positive, false negative, sensitivity and specificity rates) and two predictive values (positive, PPV, and negative, NPV). One of the main features of this approach is that it gives an overall vision of how the qualitative method performs.
