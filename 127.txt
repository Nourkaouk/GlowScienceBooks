The phenomena of Nature have been found to obey certain physical laws; one of the primary goals of physics research is to discover those laws. It has been known for several centuries that the laws of physics are appropriately expressed in the language of mathematics, so physics and mathematics have enjoyed a close connection for quite a long time. In order to connect the physical world to the mathematical world, we need to make measurements of the real world. In making measurement, we compare a physical quantity with some agreed-upon standard, and determine how many such standard units are present.
