It is well known that quantitative methods make it possible to quantify one or more analytes by using calibration curves that transform the instrumental response into the measurand, often expressed as the concentration of the analyte. Between qualitative and quantitative methods, there is still room for semi-quantitative methods of analysis. These methods provide an approximate response that enables the analyte to be roughly quantified, and they usually assign the test sample to a given class (e.g. the concentration could be high, medium, low or very low). This means that the estimate of the true concentration has a large associated uncertainty.
