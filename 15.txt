The human body has been studied by artists and scientists. The human body consists of several integrated systems that must work together for the body to function as a whole. we'll study seven of the main organ systems in our bodies. At the end of each organ system you will need to make a summary of that organ system to show: the main purpose or function of the system in the body; the main processes that take place in the system; the main components that make up the system; and the main health issues that relate to that particular system.
