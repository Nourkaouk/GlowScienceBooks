Gravitational force: The gravitational force is a force between any two bodies due to their mass. The gravitational force is the force responsible for keeping you attached to the floor at this moment: The Earthâ€™s mass is pulling you down toward its center, and your mass is attracting the Earth upward toward you. Without the gravitational force, you would be floating freely around the room. The gravitational force is always attractive, and it is the weakest of the four forces. The electromagnetic force is responsible for the attraction and repulsion of electric charges, and is responsible for the magnetic force.
