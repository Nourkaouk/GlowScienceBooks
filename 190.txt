Although often classed with touch as another skin sense, pain is actually a system with very different functions and a very different anatomical organisation. It is unpleasant, it varies greatly between individuals and, surprisingly, and the information conveyed by pain receptors provides little information about the nature of the stimulus (there is little difference between the pain due an abrasion and a nettle sting). The ancient Greeks regarded pain as an emotion not a sensation. Recording from single sensory fibres in animals reveals responses to stimuli that cause or merely threaten tissue damage - intense mechanical stimuli (such as pinch).
