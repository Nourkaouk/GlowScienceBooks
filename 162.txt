Most of the Earth’s volume consists of the solid mantle. Rocks of the crust and mantle are composed primarily of minerals of the silicate family. The basic structural unit of silicate minerals is [SiO4] 4- in which each oxygen atoms share one electron with the silicon atom. The core is Earth’s densest layer and composed mostly of iron-nickel alloy. The mantle is slightly denser than the crust and composed of silicates rich in Fe and Mg. The crust is divided into oceanic and continental crust. The former is thinner (up to 7 km), heavier and enriched in Fe and Mg.
