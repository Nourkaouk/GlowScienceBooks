We can move our entire bodies from one place to another through self-propulsion. This is called locomotion. Locomotion is different to movement. Movement is the change in shape, direction, position or size of a part of the body. Animals show movement and locomotion. What about plants? Do you think plants show movement and locomotion? Locomotion and movement are made possible through the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Muscles are stimulated by nerves to contract.
Health issues involving the musculoskeletal system: Rickets (caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium or phosphate), Arthritis (the joints become inflamed, painful and swollen), Osteoporosis.
