The flow of fluids can be characterized by a number of properties: Steadiness: Fluid flow may be steady (laminar) or full of irregular eddies (turbulent). Compressibility: Fluids generally change density with changing pressure; such fluids are called compressible. A fluid that does not change density with changing pressure is called incompressible; this is sometimes used as approximation for real fluids. Viscosity: Real fluids exhibit a kind of internal friction called viscosity that measures how “thick” the liquid is. Rotation: A fluid is rotational if it exhibits angular momentum about some point. A fluid with no such points is called irrotational.
