A variety of genes are involved in the control of cell growth and division. The cell replicates itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion known as the cell cycle. Tight regulation of this process ensures that dividing cellâ€™s DNA is copied properly, any errors in the DNA are repaired, and each daughter cell receives a full set of chromosomes. The cell cycle has checkpoints (restriction points), which allow certain genes to check for problems and halt the cycle for repairs if something goes wrong. If a cell has an error in its DNA that cannot be repaired, it may undergo self-destruction.
