An important concept about somatosensory receptors is that of the receptive field. This is the area of skin over which each individual receptor responds. Pacinian corpuscles have much larger receptive fields than Meissnerâ€™s corpuscles. Together, these and the other receptors ensure that you can feel things over your entire body surface. Once they detect a stimulus, the receptors in turn send impulses along the sensory nerves that enter the dorsal roots of the spinal cord. The axons connecting touch receptors to the spinal cord are large myelinated fibers that convey information from the periphery towards the cerebral cortex extremely rapidly.
