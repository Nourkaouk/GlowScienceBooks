To function correctly, each cell depends on thousands of proteins to do their jobs in the right places at the right times. Sometimes, gene variants (also known as mutations) prevent one or more proteins from working properly. By changing a geneâ€™s instructions for making a protein, a variant can cause a protein to malfunction or to not be produced at all. When a variant alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, it can disrupt normal development or cause a health condition. A condition caused by variants in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder.
